What is TypeScript and how does it differ from JavaScript?
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. The key difference between TypeScript and JavaScript lies in TypeScript's support for type annotations and compile-time type checking. TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This feature enables better tooling support, improved readability, and helps catch errors early in the development process.

JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language widely used for web development. JavaScript is interpreted, not compiled, and follows a dynamic typing approach. This means that variables in JavaScript hold values of any type without type enforcement, which lead to runtime errors. TypeScript addresses these issues by offering optional static typing and advanced features like interfaces, enums, and generics. These enhancements do not alter the runtime behavior of the code, as TypeScript compiles down to standard JavaScript, making it compatible with any browser or JavaScript environment.

Can you explain the basic types in TypeScript?
The basic types include string, number, boolean, array, tuple, enum, any, void, null, and undefined in TypeScript. Each type serves a specific purpose. Strings represent textual data, while numbers cover integers and floating-point values. Booleans represent true or false values. Arrays hold multiple values of the same type, and tuples allow for an array with fixed types and number of elements. Enums provide a way to define a set of named constants, enhancing code readability. Any type is a catch-all category, allowing any kind of value. Void indicates the absence of a type, commonly used in functions that do not return a value. Null and undefined types represent the absence of a value and an uninitialized variable, respectively.

TypeScript's type system helps ensure code reliability and predictability. The language enforces type checking during compilation, preventing many common errors seen in JavaScript. Developers use these types to ensure function inputs and outputs are consistent, improving code maintainability and readability. The flexibility offered by these basic types allows TypeScript to handle various application requirements effectively, making it a robust tool for web development.

How do you declare a variable in TypeScript?
Declare a variable using the let or const keyword followed by the variable name. For example, let age: number; declares a variable named age of type number. The type annotation is optional but recommended for better type checking and code clarity. TypeScript also supports the var keyword from JavaScript, but its use is generally discouraged due to its function-scoped behavior.

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding types, and these types ensure more robust code. Variables have specific types like number, string, boolean, or more complex types like arrays and objects. You assign a value to a declared variable using the assignment operator = , for instance, age = 30;. The compiler performs type checking and raises an error if the assigned value does not match the declared type. This feature provides safety and predictability in large codebases.

What is an interface in TypeScript and how is it used?
An interface in TypeScript is a structure that defines the shape of an object. Interface specifies the expected property names and their types, ensuring objects adhere to a specific format. Interfaces in TypeScript are used to enforce consistency in the structure of objects. This approach is particularly beneficial in large-scale applications where maintaining uniformity across different parts of the codebase is crucial.

Interfaces declare properties and their types, but do not implement them. Objects must contain all properties defined by the interface with the appropriate types, when it implements an interface. This method provides a clear contract of what an object should look like. Interfaces also support extending other interfaces, allowing for more complex structures and reusability of code. This feature is essential for building modular and maintainable applications in TypeScript.

How does TypeScript support object-oriented programming?
TypeScript supports object-oriented programming through its ability to create classes, interfaces, and modules. Classes are the primary building blocks for object-oriented programming in TypeScript. They encapsulate data for objects and provide a blueprint for creating specific types of objects. TypeScript enhances object-oriented programming by allowing inheritance, where one class extends another, inheriting its properties and methods. This feature promotes code reusability and a hierarchical structure in coding.

TypeScript also supports access modifiers like public, private, and protected, which control the accessibility of class members. This control over access to members ensures encapsulation, a core principle of object-oriented programming. TypeScript offers the concept of interfaces, which define the structure that classes must follow. This enforces a certain level of abstraction and contract-based programming. Implement polymorphism in TypeScript by using methods with the same name but different signatures in derived classes. This enables objects to interact in a more dynamic and flexible manner, adhering to another fundamental concept of object-oriented design.

What are TypeScript classes and how do they work?
TypeScript classes are templates for creating objects, encapsulating data and functions. TypeScript classes work by allowing developers to define a blueprint for objects, providing a clear structure. Classes in TypeScript support inheritance, allowing new classes to adopt the properties and methods of existing classes. This feature promotes code reusability and a hierarchical object-oriented structure.

A class has constructors, properties, and methods in TypeScript. The constructor method initializes new instances of the class. Properties define the characteristics of the class, and methods are functions that outline the behavior of the class. TypeScript enhances classes with access modifiers like public, private, and protected, controlling the visibility of class members. TypeScript classes also support interfaces, ensuring that certain classes comply with a specific contract, which enforces a consistent structure across different parts of an application.

Can you explain the concept of modules in TypeScript?
The concept of modules in TypeScript refers to a way of organizing code into discrete units of functionality. In TypeScript, a module is a file containing code, and each file is treated as a separate module. This system promotes better maintainability and reusability of code by allowing developers to encapsulate functionality. Modules in TypeScript export or import functions, variables, classes, and interfaces, which are essential elements in the language. These exports and imports facilitate the sharing of code between different parts of an application.

TypeScript supports both internal and external modules. Internal modules, previously known as namespaces, are used for organizing code within a single project. External modules, on the other hand, align with the ECMAScript 2015 module system and are useful when integrating with other JavaScript libraries or when separating a project into multiple files. Developers use modules in TypeScript to control the scope of variables and functions, ensuring that global namespace pollution is minimized. TypeScript also enhances code readability and debugging, by encapsulating code in modules.

How do you implement inheritance in TypeScript?
Implement inheritance using the extends keyword in TypeScript. Classes in TypeScript inherit from other classes, enabling them to adopt properties and methods from the parent class. This feature follows the object-oriented programming paradigm. Create a new class and use extends followed by the name of the class you want to inherit from, to inherit from a class. The derived class then gains access to the properties and methods of the base class.

Inheritance allows for method overriding, where the derived class modifies or extends the functionality of inherited methods. You define methods in the derived class with the same name as in the base class to achieve this. The super keyword plays a crucial role in inheritance, used to call functions on an object's parent class. Use super in the constructor of the derived class to call the constructor of the base class. This approach ensures that the base class is initialized correctly. The use of inheritance in TypeScript enhances code reusability and promotes a cleaner, more organized code structure.

What is a TypeScript decorator and what is its purpose?
A TypeScript decorator is a special kind of declaration that is attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration. The primary purpose of a TypeScript decorator is to modify or annotate class properties and methods. They provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.

Decorators serve various roles, such as modifying the behavior of a method or property, or providing metadata that are used at runtime. They are useful for writing cleaner, more readable code and for reducing boilerplate. Decorators enhance the functionality of classes or class members without altering the actual code of the class. This feature aligns with the TypeScript philosophy of making JavaScript development more efficient and robust. It processes the class or class member it is attached to, when a decorator is used, thereby extending or altering its behavior according to the logic defined in the decorator function.

How does TypeScript handle null and undefined?
TypeScript handles null and undefined as distinct types that signify absence of value and absence of definition, respectively. Variables are explicitly defined to allow null or undefined using union types in TypeScript. For example, a variable is declared as string | null | undefined to accept a string, null, or undefined. TypeScript enforces strict null checking when the strictNullChecks flag is enabled in the compiler options. This feature ensures that variables declared with a specific type do not accept null or undefined, unless explicitly defined in the type declaration.

Type guards in TypeScript are used to check for null or undefined values at runtime. A type guard like if (variable !== null && variable !== undefined) ensures that the variable is neither null nor undefined before proceeding with operations. This practice promotes code safety and helps in preventing runtime errors related to null or undefined values. TypeScript's type inference system assists in detecting potential null or undefined errors during development, providing developers with immediate feedback and guidance for robust error handling.

What are generics in TypeScript and why are they useful?
Generics in TypeScript are a feature that allows for the creation of components that work over a variety of types rather than a single one. This concept enhances code flexibility and reuse, as it enables functions, interfaces, and classes to operate with a variety of data types while ensuring type safety. The use of generics ensures that the code remains consistent in its behavior across different types.

They are useful because they enable developers to write more abstract and maintainable code. A developer writes a function or a class that works with any type by using generics, ensuring that type safety is maintained. The compiler checks the types at compile time, preventing runtime errors and ensuring that the code behaves as expected with different data types. This approach reduces the need for redundant code, thereby streamlining the development process and improving code quality.

How do you create and use enums in TypeScript?
Define them using the enum keyword followed by a set of named constants, to create enums in TypeScript. Enums in TypeScript allow you to organize a collection of related values under a single name. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability. Use enums for defining a set of named constants that have a numeric or string value.

Using enums in TypeScript involves declaring an enum type and then utilizing it in variables or function parameters. Assign its members to variables for comparison or assignment purposes, after declaring an enum. Enums provide a way to handle sets of related constants in an organized manner, ensuring that the values are constrained to the predefined set. TypeScript ensures that the values assigned to variables are from the set of defined enum members when you use enums, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors due to invalid values.

Can you describe the access modifiers in TypeScript?
Access modifiers in TypeScript are keywords that set the accessibility of properties and methods in a class. TypeScript includes three primary access modifiers: public, private, and protected. The public modifier allows members to be accessible from anywhere; this is the default setting if no access modifier is specified. Private members are accessible only within the class they are declared in, ensuring encapsulation of class internals. Protected members are similar to private ones but have the added feature of being accessible within deriving classes, supporting a more controlled form of inheritance. 

TypeScript's access modifiers enhance class-based programming by providing control over member visibility. Use of these modifiers promotes robust, maintainable code by enforcing encapsulation and protecting object integrity. Access modifiers are essential for developers to implement the principles of object-oriented programming effectively in TypeScript.

What is a namespace in TypeScript and how is it useful?
A namespace in TypeScript is a way to organize code into logical groups and avoid name collisions in larger applications. Namespace acts as a container for functions, interfaces, classes, and variables, providing a modular structure to the codebase. This organization method ensures a cleaner global scope, as it encapsulates these members within a defined context, preventing global namespace pollution.

Using namespaces simplifies the maintenance of large codebases by grouping related functionalities. It enhances code readability and reusability, particularly in projects with multiple developers. A developer access members of a namespace by using the namespace name as a prefix, which streamlines referencing and minimizes the risk of naming conflicts. Namespaces also support code reusability and scalability, making them essential for large-scale application development.

How do you annotate function types in TypeScript?
Define the types for the input parameters and the return type of the function, to annotate function types in TypeScript. TypeScript allows for precise type annotations for functions. Declare the types of the parameters in parentheses after the function name, and the return type after a colon following the parameter list. 

For example, a function that takes two numbers and returns a number is annotated as (a: number, b: number): number. This ensures that TypeScript checks the types at compile time, leading to fewer runtime errors. If the function does not return a value, you use void as the return type. Define function types that are used as types for variables, ensuring consistent implementation of function signatures across your codebase.

What is type assertion in TypeScript and how is it used?
Type assertion in TypeScript is a way to explicitly specify the type of a variable. Type assertion serves as a signal to the compiler about the data type of an entity, without performing any data conversion. This technique is useful when a developer knows the type of a variable better than what TypeScript inferred on its own. For example, when interacting with DOM elements, type assertion allows specifying a more specific type than the general HTMLElement.

There are two syntax forms for type assertion in TypeScript: the "angle-bracket" syntax and the as keyword syntax. The type is enclosed in angle brackets and placed before the variable, in the angle-bracket syntax. The as keyword syntax follows the variable with as followed by the type. Use the angle-bracket syntax when dealing with JSX, as the as keyword is preferred in other scenarios. Type assertion does not change the runtime behavior of the code but it informs the TypeScript compiler about the type to expect, thus enabling better type checking and autocompletion in development environments.

How do TypeScript and ES6 relate to each other?
TypeScript and ES6 share a relationship in which TypeScript encompasses ES6 features. TypeScript integrates all ES6 functionalities and provides additional features like static typing. This integration means that any valid ES6 code is also valid TypeScript code, facilitating seamless usage of ES6 features within a TypeScript context. TypeScript extends the capabilities of ES6, adding features like interfaces, enums, and decorators, which are not present in ES6. 

Developers use TypeScript for its strong typing and object-oriented programming capabilities, which enhance the robustness and maintainability of large codebases. It compiles down to JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with any JavaScript environment. This compilation process translates TypeScript's additional features into equivalent JavaScript code, compatible with ES6 standards. In essence, TypeScript offers an extended, more feature-rich environment that aligns with and builds upon the foundations laid by ES6.

What are union types in TypeScript?
Union types in TypeScript allow a variable to store values of multiple types. Union types enhance flexibility in variable usage by permitting different types to be assigned to a single variable. Union types are defined using the pipe ('|') symbol, distinguishing them as a combination of two or more types. For example, a variable hold both a string and a number type when declared as let example: string | number.

The use of union types is particularly beneficial in scenarios where a variable's value is not confined to a single type. They ensure type safety by allowing only the specified types to be assigned to the variable. Union types are the preferred choice, In cases where functions or variables need to accommodate diverse data types. This approach prevents errors that might arise from the inappropriate assignment of types, ensuring robustness in TypeScript applications.

How do you declare and use an array in TypeScript?
Declaring and using an array involves specifying the type of elements that the array will hold in TypeScript. Use square brackets after the type of the elements, to declare an array. For example, let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; declare an array of numbers. Also use the generic array type Array<elementType>, such as let numbers: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];. This approach is useful for defining arrays of complex types.

Access its elements using their index to use an array in TypeScript, manipulate the array with methods like push, pop, slice, and iterate over the elements using loops or array methods like forEach and map. The array type in TypeScript ensures type safety, meaning you cannot add elements of a different type to the array. TypeScript throws a compile-time error if you try to add a string to a number array, ensuring the array's integrity. Remember to declare the array as const if you do not intend to reassign it to a different array.

What is tuple in TypeScript and how does it differ from an array?
A tuple is a type of array where the number of elements and the type of each element are known and specified in TypeScript. Unlike a regular array that typically contains elements of a single type, tuples allow for a fixed sequence of elements with varied types. For example, a tuple is defined to hold a string, a number, and a boolean, in that specific order. This precision in defining the type and order of elements is the key difference between tuples and arrays.

Tuples are particularly useful when a function needs to return multiple values of different types. They enforce a strict structure and sequence, ensuring each element in the tuple occupies a specific position with a designated type. This contrasts with standard arrays where elements are generally of the same type and are dynamically added or removed. Tuples thus provide a way to group and pass around a fixed set of heterogeneously typed items, enhancing code readability and type safety in TypeScript applications.

Can you explain the 'any' type in TypeScript?
The any type in TypeScript allows variables to hold values of any type. This type is the most flexible in TypeScript, as it permits any kind of value, including numbers, strings, and objects, without enforcing strict type checking. Developers use the 'any' type in scenarios where they want to opt-out of type checking, typically when dealing with dynamic content or when interacting with JavaScript libraries that are not type-safe.

The 'any' type is useful for transitioning a project from JavaScript to TypeScript. It provides a way to gradually implement strict typing without needing to refactor all existing code at once. Overuse of the 'any' type undermines the benefits of TypeScript's static typing system. It should be used sparingly, as it essentially bypasses the compiler's type checks. It's better to use the 'any' type than to make incorrect assumptions about its type, if a variable's type is uncertain.
